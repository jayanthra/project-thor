Project Thor, nicknamed "Rods from God," is a theoretical kinetic bombardment weapon system that would deploy tungsten rods from orbital platforms to strike Earth-based targets. The concept involves satellites carrying cylindrical tungsten rods—typically envisioned as being about 20 feet long and 1 foot in diameter, weighing several tons each.
The weapon would work through pure kinetic energy rather than explosives. When released from orbit, these dense tungsten rods would accelerate due to Earth's gravity, potentially reaching speeds of over 11,000 mph (Mach 10) by the time they hit their target. The kinetic energy from such an impact would be equivalent to a small nuclear weapon—estimates suggest the force of a large conventional bomb or small tactical nuke, but without the radiation, fallout, or political complications of nuclear weapons.
The theoretical advantages include nearly instantaneous global strike capability, difficulty in defending against such weapons (no current missile defense systems are designed for this threat), and the ability to penetrate deeply buried or hardened targets. The rods would be virtually undetectable until impact and could strike anywhere on Earth within minutes.
However, significant technical and practical challenges have prevented development. These include the enormous costs of launching heavy tungsten rods into orbit, the complex orbital mechanics required for precise targeting, and current limitations in satellite technology for guidance and communication systems. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty also prohibits placing weapons of mass destruction in orbit, though kinetic weapons exist in a legal gray area.
While the U.S. military has studied kinetic bombardment concepts, no confirmed active development of such systems has occurred. The idea remains largely theoretical, appearing more often in science fiction than in actual military planning documents.
